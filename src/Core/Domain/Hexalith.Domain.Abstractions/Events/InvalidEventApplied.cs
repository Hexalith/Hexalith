/// <summary>
/// Represents an invalid event that was applied to an aggregate in the domain.
/// This record is used to capture and track events that could not be properly
/// processed by an aggregate, allowing for error handling, logging, and debugging
/// of event processing failures in the domain-driven design context.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This record is particularly useful in event sourcing scenarios where we need to:
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><description>Track failed event applications for audit purposes</description></item>
/// <item><description>Debug issues with event processing in aggregates</description></item>
/// <item><description>Handle recovery scenarios where events couldn't be applied</description></item>
/// </list>
/// The record stores both the metadata about the failed event application and the
/// actual event content in serialized form for later analysis.
///
/// <para>
/// The EventContent property contains the JSON serialized form of the event,
/// which can be deserialized back to the original event type when needed.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// Example usage:
/// <code>
/// try
/// {
///     aggregate.ApplyEvent(someEvent);
/// }
/// catch (UnsupportedEventException ex)
/// {
///     var invalidEvent = InvalidEventApplied.CreateNotSupportedAppliedEvent(
///         nameof(MyAggregate),
///         aggregate.Id,
///         someEvent,
///         ex.Message);
