# Hexalith.Application.TopologicalSorting

A topological sorting algorithm for parallel task execution is a technique used to schedule tasks that can be executed concurrently. 

The goal of the topological sorting algorithm is to find a valid sequence in which the tasks can be executed that respects the dependencies between them. 
This is important because it ensures that no task is executed before its dependencies have been completed. 

A topological sorting algorithm is used to find a valid sequence of tasks that can be executed in parallel. 

Once we have a valid sequence of tasks, we can execute them in parallel. 
For example, if two tasks have no dependencies between them, they can be executed concurrently. 
However, if a task depends on the output of another task, it must wait until that task has completed before it can begin. 

Parallel task execution is important because it can significantly improve the performance of an application. 
By executing tasks concurrently, we can reduce the overall execution time of the application and improve its responsiveness.
